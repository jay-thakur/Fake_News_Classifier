# Fake_News_Classifier

## Why do you need this ?
As this is a social media era, social media users are growing day by day & thus it has become an one of information source. But some people are using it to fulfill their own interest & thus spreading false information. 

I like to be updated & read news whenever I get spare time. I have realised that so many news/articles are going through social media, which are not true. For example - 
writing fake articles about anything, morphing images, audio & video to malign anyoneâ€™s image. 

Few things which motivated me to work on this idea is -

In India, the supreme court had filed cases against spreading false information. 
Also in this covid time, so many people had spread false rumors regarding lockdown, due to which so many migrants from other indian states had to suffer & many lost their lives, closed ones. 
Another example is -  In my hometown, there is no shortage of oxygen, even the District magistrate told that there is no shortage of oxygen in my hometown district, we have surplus that we are sending to other districts but I have so much news regarding shortage of oxygen on fb groups, whatsapp messages, twitter & through other channels. This is creating a panic situation among people.

To tackle this issue I decided to use AI to detect fake news so that i/people can verify  the authenticity of any news articles.
